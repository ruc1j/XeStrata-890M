/// start (about 51 GiB for IQ3_S), after the table has been opened, and an unbuffered read into that arena needs the
/// pages locked.  A locked table takes its share of the lockable memory first, so on a 64 GB PC (Windows, RTX 5070,
/// 2026-10-26) the policy that only looked at "table + 8 GiB available" admitted the table and the expert load then
/// failed with ERROR_WORKING_SET_QUOTA (1453).  The table is therefore admitted only when RAM holds the table AND the
/// arena the engine will still fill AND the headroom, all measured against what is available BEFORE either is
/// allocated.  Unknown memory telemetry, an unknown table size or an unknown arena size admit nothing (the direct
/// reads of 0.2.6 stay).
///
/// `experts_ram_bytes`: the native expert layout's total (every layer's blob x experts), 0 when it is not known.
